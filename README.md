## General info
In this project I create a numeric matrix processor which can perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and dealing with inverse matrices.

## Technologies
* Java - version 15.0.1

## Code Example
```
1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix by a constant
3. Multiply matrices
0. Exit
Your choice: 1
Enter size of first matrix: 4 5
Enter first matrix:
1 2 3 4 5
3 2 3 2 1
8 0 9 9 1
1 3 4 5 6
Enter size of second matrix: 4 5
Enter second matrix:
1 1 4 4 5
4 4 5 7 8
1 2 3 9 8
1 0 0 0 1
The result is:
2.0 3.0 7.0 8.0 10.0 
7.0 6.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 
9.0 2.0 12.0 18.0 9.0 
2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 

1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix by a constant
3. Multiply matrices
0. Exit
Your choice: 2
Enter size of matrix: 2 2
Enter matrix:
1.5 7.0
6.0 5.0
Enter constant: 0.5
The result is:
0.75 3.5 
3.0 2.5 

1. Add matrices

0. Exit
Your choice: 1
Enter size of first matrix: 2 2
Enter first matrix:
1 2
3 2
Enter size of second matrix: 1 1
